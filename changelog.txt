Change Log for FISSFC: the (Fi)recloud (S)ervice (S)elector
=======================================================================
Terms used below:  HL = high level interface, LL = low level interface

v0.16.14 - Hotfix: Fixed warning messages that would cause errors if executed.

v0.16.13 - Dockerfile updated to use local files rather than pull from pypi;
           Enhanced installation of Google Cloud SDK and ensured its
           availability to subprocesses; Fixed a broken LL test.

v0.16.12 - Removed gcloud requirement from README (automatic as of v0.16.11);
           Updated Dockerfile and added .dockerignore

v0.16.11 - On install, will install gcloud if not available and not running in
           Google AppEngine; Now attempts to set authentication credentials if
           they have not been set; Added license; Added new LL functions:
           get_method_configurations() and get_api_methods_definitions();
           Removed LL function get_bucket().

v0.16.10 - Formatting cleanup to HL commands config_get and config_template;
           fixed tests that were broken due to change in API response code for
           space_delete (200 -> 202).

v0.16.9 -  Hotfix; modified how subprocess.call() is utilized to avoid
           problems on Google AppEngine, where it is prohibited.

v0.16.8 -  Hotfix; entity_import corrected to only strip newline characters.

v0.16.7 -  Enabled LL and HL access to the linkExistingEntities field of the
           copy entities API, enabling copying set entities to workspaces that
           already contain some portion of the entities comprising the set.

v0.16.6 -  Hotfix; workspace method config LL commands updated to comply with
           API changes; setup.py updated to reflect current authorship and
           contact information.

v0.16.5 -  Added 3 new HL commands - config_stop(), entity_delete(), and
           get_bucket() - and one new LL command - overwrite_workspace_config();
           Updated 2 HL commands - space_delete(): accept new API return codes,
           update_repository_method(): added snapshot comment string - and one
           LL command - config_parse(): added new precedence logic and ability
           to specify arbitrary attributes via **kwargs; Updated authentication
           to use google.auth instead of the deprecated oauth2client, additional
           related enhancements include use of a single requests session for the
           duration of use (fixed a failure mode in supervisor caused by the
           creation of too many connections in rapid succession) and the ability
           to specify credentials file via config or CLI.

v0.16.4 -  Correctly escape characters in JSON/CLI interaction; Allow Service 
           Account FireCloud users to run FISS; Consolidated into a global fcconfig 
           and cache credentials; Fixed status to health change; Enable the updating 
           of entities by allowing the 'update:' header; Enable access token caching;
           Fix for API breaking changes in create workspace/clone_workspace.

v0.16.3 -  HL flow_start() renamed to config_start, because only configs can
           actually be submitted for execution (i.e. 'started'), and only
           when residing in a workspace; other HL flow_* commands renamed to
           meth_*, to reflect that they operate upon methods in the FC method
           repo; added new config_put(), config_new() and config_template HL
           commands; added more HL tests and refactored others; introduced new
           main_as_cli() routine as the place which calls the true main() but
           then prints the returned result to stdout [allowing existing main()
           to be used in a more function-oriented way; added fccore routines
           which facilitate editing content (e.g. files, method configs)

v0.16.1 -  Completed print stmt refactoring started in 0.16.0; added entity_type
           to config state object; added attr_list & config_delete high level
           commands, and additional regression tests

v0.16.0 -  Major refactoring: yapsy plugin system removed, replaced with
           ConfigParser module, which employs simpler and clearer INI-style
           config files (similar to GIT config); to enable high level API
           (HL) to be called from other Python scripts (not just UNIX cli),
           discontinue using print statements to convey results of HL calls,
           in favor of returning objects (which the CLI repl will simply
           print at exit; put root api_url into config state, to greatly
           simplify high- and low-level API code by eliminating need for
           each CMD and API func to accept a root_url param

v0.15.2 -  Introduce __get wrapper for requests.get(), to lessen headers
           boilerplate in the code and make it possible for --verbose flag
           to be applied to ALL of the low-level API (e.g. to display the
           URI of REST calls) at once, without having to pass verbosity flag
           up and down call stack

v0.15.1 - New high-level 'config_get' command; adjust the low-level methods
          create_workspace_config() and update_workspace_config() to reflect
          newer FC api; plus contributed fixes to submission & queue routines

v0.15.0 - New 'config_validate' and 'runnable' commands for evaluating configurations
          against the state of the data model in a workspace.

v0.14.1 - Bugfixes and validation for supervisor mode. Make flow_set_acl smarter,
          and make the snapshot_id argument be optional, defaulting to the latest.

v0.14.0 - proj_list command for listing available billing projects. Rename
          recover_supervisor to supervise_recover, for conceptual symmetry.

v0.13.2 - Fix getting workspace attributes when not using the attributes flag.

v0.13.1 - More helpful error checking for loadfile format during entity_import.

v0.13.0 - Some fixes to match API changes in FireCloud Orchestration and
          several new commands:

          supervise -- a robust mechanism of submitting related
            workflows similar to Firehose workflows. Workflows described in DOT
            can be submitted and monitored in one command, and fissfc will
            monitor the entire workflow until completion.

          recover_supervisor -- supervise saves workflow execution state after
            each API call, so that the monitor can be restarted with this
            command in case of a FISS crash.

          attr_set -- set attributes in a workspace.

          attr_delete -- delete attributes in a workspace.

          attr_copy -- copy attributes from one workspace to another.

          entity_copy -- copy entities from one workspace to another. Note that
            referential constraints currently limit the ability to overwrite
            entities in the target workspace.

v0.12.0 - Large refactor of argument handling for FISS. Almost all arguments
          are now passed using flags instead of positional arguments, enabling
          the argument namespace to be shared by command iterators. This allows
          sset_loop (a new looping command) to call multiple FISS commands
          without having to reparse arguments.

          New FISS command for submitting workflows, 'flow_submit'.

v0.11.0 - New endpoint for paginated entity queries, also used by attr_get
          to more reliably return attributes on large workspaces.

          Also added new FISS command `attr_fill_null`, which will assign null
          sentinel files to entities which do not have a valid attribute. This,
          in a sense, "fills in" the sparse matrix of data for a given list of
          attributes.

v0.10.1 - Fix Py3 compatibility issues.

v0.10.0 - Remove `fiss` entrypoint, to not overwrite fiss 1.0 installs. New fiss
          "mop" command, to clean files that are not referenced in a workspace
          attribute from the underlying google bucket.

v0.9.6 - Fix expected response code for entity_import

v0.9.5 - Fix urllib compatibility issue in upload_entities

v0.9.4 - Add ability to change inputs and other configuration details in a
         workspace configuration

v0.9.3 - Improved documentation. Fixed url for method configurations in a workspace.

v0.9.2 - Remove file-based check for getting application default credentials,
         improving support for Jupyter-based sessions.

v0.9.1 - Fix expected return code for flow_new.

v0.9.0 - Replace Httplib2 with Requests, which resolves the SSL handshake issue
         for python3. Added six to required packages, making FireCloud fully
         compatible with python 2 & 3. Add links to FireCloud's swagger
         documentation.

v0.8.1 - Improved test coverage. Enhanced interactive classes. Fixed error logic
         to match new server response.

v0.8.0 - firecloud.api now boasts 100% coverage of existing (useful) API endpoints.

         Several api endpoints for manipulating NIH credentials and profile info
         will deliberately remain unimplemented unless a good reason arises. Any
         discrepancies are noted in the api module's docstring; see
         help(firecloud.api) for a lengthy overview.

         New Method and Configuration objects.
         >>> m = Method("broad-firecloud-gdac", "gistic2", 1)


v0.7.4 - FISS functions can now display their source code with the -F option.

v0.7.3 - Improved documentation, with docstrings for every public function.
         This enables python's builtin help system to be used from the REPL.
         To see all the available firecloud api calls:
         % python
         >>> import firecloud
         >>> help(firecloud.api)

v0.7.2 - Fix some commands that broke with the API changes

v0.7.1 - Add workspace functions for importing entities and creating entity sets.

v0.7.0 - Renamed package "firecloud", replacing "fissfc"
            - firecloud_cli.py renamed fiss.py
            - firecloud_api.py renamed api.py
         Added workspace class for more flexible python interactivity. Example:
           >>> w = Workspace.new("broad-firecloud-testing", "my_workspace")
           >>> w.bucket()
           "fc-92e4ic0a-60fb-454a-8ue0-d0efea803421"
           >>> w.lock()
         Added better error messaging for unexpected FireCloud Errors

v0.6.2 - Add '--protected' option for workspace creation.

v0.6.1 - Firecloud production API is now https://api.firecloud.org/api

v0.6.0 - Refactored the argument structure for inferring a default project.
         Instead of passing the namespace as an optional input to a
         subcommand, the project can be overriden explicitly with the -p
         top-level flag. This cleans up the syntax for many commands, and
         makes the help clearer.

         Add --all option to space_list
         attr_get:
             * attributes now given a a list of positional arguments,
                  instead of comma-separated
             * entity type limited to firecloud supported entities
         Fixed help messages for many commands


v0.5.0 - Add python 3 support, so that fissfc should be installable to
         either version. A TLS issue may still prevent fissfc from
         working on some versions of python.

v0.4.1 - Add attr_get subcommand, as a replacement for fiss annot_get.
         Clarify error message.

v0.4.0 - Implement default value for google project into most subcommands

v0.3.2 - Add check in firecloud_api for  the existence of gcloud credentials

v0.3.1 - Add confirmation prompt for delete commands, and a
         Flag to override them.

v0.3.0 - Added support for Yapsy plugins.

v0.0.1 - Initial Release
