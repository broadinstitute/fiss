====================
Description
====================

Firecloud API bindings and FISS Command-Line interface. 

This package was formerly known as "fissfc", but has evolved
to provide more sophisticated abstractions for interacting
with firecloud in addition to the command line tool.

====================
Requirements
====================

Firecloud uses the Google Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) to manage
authorization. To use the firecloud CLI or API, you must install the SDK and 
login locally with

    gcloud auth login


====================
Release Notes
====================
v0.8.0 - New Method and Configuration objects.

v0.7.4 - FISS functions can now display their source code with the -F option.

v0.7.3 - Improved documentation, with docstrings for every public function. 
         This enables python's builtin help system to be used from the REPL.
         To see all the available firecloud api calls:
         % python
         >>> import firecloud
         >>> help(firecloud.api)

v0.7.2 - Fix some commands that broke with the API changes

v0.7.1 - Add workspace functions for importing entities and creating entity sets.

v0.7.0 - Renamed package "firecloud", replacing "fissfc" 
            - firecloud_cli.py renamed fiss.py
            - firecloud_api.py renamed api.py
         Added workspace class for more flexible python interactivity. Example:
           >>> w = Workspace.new("broad-firecloud-testing", "my_workspace")
           >>> w.bucket()
           "fc-92e4ic0a-60fb-454a-8ue0-d0efea803421"
           >>> w.lock()
         Added better error messaging for unexpected FireCloud Errors

v0.6.2 - Add '--protected' option for workspace creation.

v0.6.1 - Firecloud production API is now https://api.firecloud.org/api

v0.6.0 - Refactored the argument structure for inferring a default project. 
         Instead of passing the namespace as an optional input to a 
         subcommand, the project can be overriden explicitly with the -p 
         top-level flag. This cleans up the syntax for many commands, and 
         makes the help clearer. 

         Add --all option to space_list
         attr_get:
             * attributes now given a a list of positional arguments, 
                  instead of comma-separated
             * entity type limited to firecloud supported entities
         Fixed help messages for many commands


v0.5.0 - Add python 3 support, so that fissfc should be installable to 
         either version. A TLS issue may still prevent fissfc from 
         working on some versions of python.

v0.4.1 - Add attr_get subcommand, as a replacement for fiss annot_get.
         Clarify error message. 

v0.4.0 - Implement default value for google project into most subcommands

v0.3.2 - Add check in firecloud_api for  the existence of gcloud credentials

v0.3.1 - Add confirmation prompt for delete commands, and a 
         Flag to override them.

v0.3.0 - Added support for Yapsy plugins. 

v0.0.1 - Initial Release
