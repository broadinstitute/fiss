Release Notes
====================
v0.6.2 - Add '--protected' option for workspace creation.

v0.6.1 - Firecloud production API is now https://api.firecloud.org/api

v0.6.0 - Refactored the argument structure for inferring a default project. 
         Instead of passing the namespace as an optional input to a 
         subcommand, the project can be overriden explicitly with the -p 
         top-level flag. This cleans up the syntax for many commands, and 
         makes the help clearer. 

         Add --all option to space_list
         attr_get:
             * attributes now given a a list of positional arguments, 
                  instead of comma-separated
             * entity type limited to firecloud supported entities
         Fixed help messages for many commands


v0.5.0 - Add python 3 support, so that fissfc should be installable to 
         either version. A TLS issue may still prevent fissfc from 
         working on some versions of python.

v0.4.1 - Add attr_get subcommand, as a replacement for fiss annot_get.
         Clarify error message. 

v0.4.0 - Implement default value for google project into most subcommands

v0.3.2 - Add check in firecloud_api for  the existence of gcloud credentials

v0.3.1 - Add confirmation prompt for delete commands, and a 
         Flag to override them.

v0.3.0 - Added support for Yapsy plugins. 

v0.0.1 - Initial Release
